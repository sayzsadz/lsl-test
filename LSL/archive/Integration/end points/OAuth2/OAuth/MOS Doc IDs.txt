Hi Team

We came across the following error.

ORA-29106: Cannot import PKCS #12 wallet.
ORA-24247: network access denied by access control list (ACL)

The steps we followed are below listed.
1. Created a Oracle Wallet using 'orapki wallet create' command
2. added the trusted the certificate using the same command 'orapki wallet add'
3. created a access control list and added required host
4. made request to required REST service from the following function adn parameter respectively
function: APEX_WEB_SERVICE.make_rest_request
parameters: p_url, p_http_method, p_body, p_wallet_path, p_wallet_pwd

Going forward I have read My Oracle Support Document Doc ID 1675966.1 and I mentioned it for your reference.

Please be kind enough to attend to this incident and let us know the resolution.
